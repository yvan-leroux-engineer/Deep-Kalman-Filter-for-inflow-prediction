## Context
This project serves to apply the knowledge gained during the RCP 217 module, "Artificial Intelligence for Multimedia Data." The chosen case study revolves around implementing a neural network for predictive Deep Kalman filtering, inspired by Rahul et al.'s paper. The primary focus is on assessing the model's predictive capabilities on time series data.

## Objectives
- Implement and train a Deep Kalman Filter network.
- Analyze the network's performance on various time series datasets.
